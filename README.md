# SMS-to-Email
This Python application parses and processes the backup output of the Android application "SMS Backup and Restore" by Carbonite. 

Run the application as you would a bash script:

./smsparse.py

...and then just follow the prompts.

Once the script is complete you will find a .mbox file with the name of your choosing in the current ddirectory and a directory called "sms" with .eml copies of each SMS found in the backup.

This software is in no way supported by authors of the application and is to be used at your own risk. The software is provided with no warranty, whatsoever, including merchantability and is to be considered development software for evaluation and testing purposes only.
